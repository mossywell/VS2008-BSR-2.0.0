<h1>Menu Items</h1>
Once installed and running, BSR is administered via the context menu,
which can be accessed by right-clicking on the icon in the System Tray. The
menu looks like this:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\context-menu.png"></div><br><br>
The menu options are explained in the following table:<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Option</td>
<td class="bold">Explanation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Update Web Info Now</td>
<td>This will cause BSR immediately to go and update the web stats
rather than wait for the next cycle. You might want to do this if you've just rebooted the
router and are waiting impatiently for BSR to "realise" that it can now
reconnect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Update Stats Now</td>
<td>This will cause the downstream speed and noise ratio to be updated on the
system tray icon. In general, the former does not change and the latter changes
regularly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Run Custom Commands Now</td>
<td>If there are any custom commands that are configured to be run after a reboot,
they can be run immediately. You will not normally have to select this option. <b>Note
that when custom commands are running, the automatic reboot feature is temporarily
disabled until a successful connection is made to the Internet again.</b> The reason
for this is that it is possible to have a custom command that causes a disconnection,
such as a change to the threshold SNR. We do not want BSR to reboot
the router during this phase as the custom settings will be lost (or a reboot cycle will
ensue).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pause / Re-start BSR</td>
<td>This pauses or re-starts BSR. See <a href="running-desktop.htm">
The Desktop</a> for more information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display Current Stats</td>
<td>This opens up a web browser with the stats web page that is seen when logging
into the router and looking at the router stats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display Detailed Stats</td>
<td>This displays, in the default text editor, the detailed diagnostics that
are often requested, particularly on the <a href="http://www.skyuser.co.uk">
Skyuser</a> forums, when investigating router problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display ADSL Username and Password</td>
<td>This displays a dialog that shows the ADSL (not web login) user name and
password. With these pieces of information, other routers can be used to connect to
Sky Broadband. (Though doing so is unsupported and breaks the Sky BB contract.)
Whilst the dialog box is open, BSR continues in the background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start Telnet Daemon</td>
<td>This starts the telnet daemon on the router. By default, telnet is disabled
on the Sky routers. <b>Note that there is no authentication to the telnet
login, so in secure environments, it is recommended that telnet be disabled.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kill Telnet Daemon</td>
<td>This kills the telnet daemon on the router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reboot Router Now</td>
<td>Reboot the router immediately. During such a reboot, the <i>automatic</i>
reboot feature is temporarily disabled until a successful connection is made
to the Internet again. If you select this option, you will get a confirmatory
warning before the reboot takes place in case you change your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter / Leave Maintenance Mode</td>
<td>This puts BSR into "maintenance mode". This is where the
whole application  runs as usual except that the auto-reboot functionality is
disabled. This is a useful mode when there is router maintenance happening but
you don't want to put the whole application on pause. For example, you might
want to monitor continuously whilst experimenting with some of the router's
settings.<BR>
NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you do not enter Maintenance Mode if
you are in a reboot cycle. (You will receive a warning if you try to do this.)
This is because BSR will have no way to know when the cycle is
complete and will therefore stay permanently in the middle of a reboot
cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display Log in Log Viewer</td>
<td>This displays the current day's log file in the log viewer. Note that the
log files can get quite big (depending on the logging level), so keep an eye
on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>View / Edit Config File</td>
<td>This opens up the config file in notepad. From here it can be edited and saved. Doing so
requires a restart of BSR for the changes to take effect. Details of the config file
can be found here: <a href="running-configfile.htm">The Config File</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display Readme</td>
<td>This displays the Readme file (README.TXT) in the default text file editor,
probably notepad. Whilst the Readme is open, BSR continues in the
background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Help</td>
<td>This displays this Help file. Whilst the Help is open, BSR
continues in the background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>About...</td>
<td>The About screen. Whilst the dialog box is open, BSR continues in the
background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exit</td>
<td>Exit BSR now. Any open threads are killed off and any threads that have
to be killed of (rather than waiting for them to close), are logged in the Event Log.</td>
</tr>
