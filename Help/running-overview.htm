<h2><a name="Why_BSR">Why BSR?</a></h2>
One of the well-known problems with Sky Broadband is the &quot;V1&quot;
router that Sky used to provide with its broadband service: the Netgear DG834GT.
The terms and conditions state that the router supplied by Sky
must be used to connect to Sky Broadband. (More accurately, the terms and
conditions state that the customer must allow Sky access to the router at all
times.) To ensure that users don't even
try to use their own router, Sky have modified the firmware on more tha one
occasion to prevent users accessing their own ADSL user name and password.<br>
<br>

Why would anyone want to use their own router? Mainly because, as many
users of Sky Broadband have noticed, the router supplied by Sky sometimes
loses its
connection to the ADSL service, and as a result the router needs rebooting.
The amount of rebooting required varies from none at all for the lucky few,
to many times a day.<br><br>

There are four approaches to resolving this that have been tried.
<ol>
<li>Stop using Sky Broadband altogether. For most, this isn't an option because
the cost is competitive and when it works, it works well.</li>
<li>Find a method of obtaining the ADSL user name and password and then
use one's own router. Two such a methods were uncovered by "Asinine
Monkey" (see his excellent web site for more information: 
<a href="http://www.asininemonkey.com/netgear-dg834gt-hacking.html">
Netgear DG834GT Hacking</a>) and more recently by "Mel".</li>
<li>Automate the process of rebooting the router when the Internet connection
goes down. This is what this application is all about.</li>
<li>Update the firmware with one that is not so unreliable. This is the
approach that both Sky and some users have taken (though Sky's firmware again
attempts to lock users out of the router).</li>
</ol>
What about the name "BSR"? Initially, it was called "Bounce Sky Router" because
all I could
think of when naming it is "well, what does it do?". However, "Bounce Sky
Router" has become a bit too much typing, so it is now simply "BSR".

<h2><a name="Which_Router">Which router can I use this with?</a></h2>
BSR was designed to work with the Netgear DG834GT running Sky's
firmware only, but it has since been tested successfully against the following
firmwares:
<ul>
<li>Netgear 1.02.04</li>
<li>Netgear 1.02.09</li>
<li>Sky 1.02.28</li>
<li>UberGT 1.02.04 1.05 Beta 3</li>
<li>Sky 1.03.??</li>
</ul>
It may work with other firmwares (or indeed for the adventurous,
other routers) but you'll be on your own if you try this!

<h2><a name="Non_Technical">I'm not technical - how do I use it?</a></h2>
If you're not technical, it's probably safe to assume that you haven't changed
the web login password. If so, then
just install and run it. As Alan Partridge once said: "It really is that simple."

<h2><a name="Anything_Else">Is there anything else I need to know before
running it?</a></h2>
Yes - one important thing. The router only allows one IP address (i.e. one PC /
laptop) to log into the router via a web browser at any one time. If a second
IP address attempts to log into the router whilst the first is logged in*,
there is an error: "Another Administrator online.". BSR uses the
web login to obtain its information. Therefore, if you try to run more than one
copy on the local network, all but the first copy will generate lots of errors.
It won't cause any problems, but it won't work either, so it is strongly
recommended only to run this on one IP address on the network. This restriction
includes Fast User Switching in XP and Vista. If you try to run BSR
in two
separate sessions on the same PC, you will receive an error. This is by design.
<br>
* Actually, the router "remembers" the last IP address that logged into it for
a few minutes even after the web browser is closed and during this few minutes,
an error can still result. The "few minutes" is configurable in the web login:
Login to the router --> Set Password --> "Administrator login times out after
idle for &lt;minutes&gt; minutes".

<h2><a name="How_Does_It_Work">How does it work?</a></h2>
This application is simple in concept. Basically, it connects to two web
sites at regular intervals (30 seconds by default). The two web sites are Ebay
UK and Google UK, but they can be changed. I chose those two on the basis 
that they "never" go down. So, if we lose connection to both, the problem is
almost certainly at our end and not theirs!<br><br>
If connection to both sites is lost (or times out), the application sends a command
to the router to reboot it. During the reboot phase, it disables the automatic reboot
functionality until it has successfully connected back to the two web sites. This
prevents a reboot loop. That's it - simple! The results of the attempts to connect
to the Internet pop up when the mouse is hovered over the application in the 
System Tray.

<h2><a name="Does_It_Do_Anything_Else">Does it do anything else?</a></h2>
Indeed it does. It actually can do a number of other things - and the list gets
longer with each version, so this is just a sample:
<ul>
<li>It monitors the downstream speed and signal to noise ratio (SNR or "noise
margin" as it is sometimes called) every 15 seconds by default. It does this by
connecting to the router, opening up the web page that displays the stats, and
then parses out the two values. Both are also displayed on the System Tray
tooltip.</li>
<li>Any changes to operating parameters on the router are lost when the router
is rebooted. So, if you wanted to change the default SNR threshold, that change
would be lost at the next reboot. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, this
application can send a set of "custom commands" to the router once it has
rebooted or indeed on demand.</li>
<li>It also allows the telnet daemon easily to be started and stopped. Telnetting
into the router opens up a whole new world of configuration possibilities, which
are too numerous to go into here, but one excellent possibility is the ability
to configure inbound Port Address Translation, which can't be done via the web
interface.</li>
<li>It displays the ADSL user name and password. It does this by running a
command on the router to send the user name and password to a text file on 
the router and it then downloads the file, and parses the output.</li>
<li>It allows the router's inbuilt stats web page to be displayed.</li>
<li>It allows the router to be rebooted manually. Note that the custom commands
mentioned above will run even after a manual reboot.</li>
<li>There are a few other functions that may come and go as this
application is developed further. Take a look at this help file for more
information.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="When_is_auto_reboot_disabled">When is auto-reboot disabled?</a></h2>
The five circumstances that the router will not be rebooted even though Internet
connectivity has been lost are:
<ol>
<li>BSR has been paused.</li>
<li>The router has been rebooted automatically or manually and has not yet
reconnected to the Internet.</li>
<li>The custom commands are running automatically or manually and the 
router has not yet reconnected to the Internet.</li>
<li>The application is on a computer that is within 60 seconds of coming out
of suspension or hibernation. The reason for this is that immediately following
a resume from hibernation, the application may not be able to connect to the
router because the IP stack has not reloaded.</li>
<li>BSR has lost connection to the router.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Reboot_Success">How do I know that the auto-reboot was successful?</a></h2>
BSR uses the uptime from the router and the time taken to reboot
to decide if the reboot was a success. It logs the success (or otherwise) in
the log file.

<h2><a name="How_Technical">How does it do all these things?</a></h2>
How does it run commands on the router? I am indebted to "Asinine Monkey" for
his
URL injection method of running commands on the router. Basically, it uses a 
"hole" in one of the web scripts installed on the router to run any command. 
Therefore, all commands are done using this method. The custom commands
also use this method. The syntax of the URL is outside the scope of this help file,
but a good read of the "Asinine Monkey" web site will fill in the details.

<h2><a name="The_Readme">Version History? Future plans?</a></h2>
Both of these topics are covered in the readme file called README.TXT. Before
sending me a PM for a suggested enhancement, check the readme as I may already be
doing it. 

<h2><a name="Poison">This is a great app! Can I pay for it?</a></h2>
So far, it's been written out of the goodness of my brain. However, if I get lots of
PMs at <a href=" www.skyuser.co.uk">www.skyuser.co.uk</a> insisting that
I take payment, then I might agree to a pint of flat southern bitter or maybe a 
bottle of Guinness or two! If I get really nagged, I'll eventually divulge my
Paypal account address. :)

<h2><a name="License">Is there a license agreement?</a></h2>
Yes - it can be found <a href="license.htm">here</a>.
