<h1>Logging</h1>
Logging is via two locations:
<ol>
<li>The log file</li>
<li>The Windows Application Event Log</li>
</ol>
Nearly all logging is via the log file. However, the only circumstance that
the Application Event Log is used is when BSR is unable to
write to the log file for whatever reason. This causes BSR to
close down immediately and the event is logged in the Windows Application
Event Log.<br><br>

<h2><a name="The_Log_File">The Log File</a></h2>
The log file is where the normal activity of BSR is logged. This
includes various types of information, all of which are prefixed by the local
computer's date and time. The actual amount of information shown is
customisable. See <a href="running-configfile.htm">Configuration</a> for
more information.<br><br>

The name of the log file changes every day and is
"Mossywell.BSR.&lt;date&gt;.log". It can be
found, by default in Windows XP, in "C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My
Documents\Mossywell\BSR", or in Vista in "C:\Users\&lt;user
name&gt;\Documents\Mossywell\BSR". In addition, this location also
contains old log files. The number of old log files that are kept is
user-definable, but is 10 by default. Older log files are deleted ("pruned")
automatically.<br><br>

The easiest way to open today's log file
is via the <a href="running-contextmenu.htm">Context Menu
</a>.

The six types of information, along with the associated logging levels are:
<ol>
<li>ERROR (shown with logging level 1 or above) - This is when an event has
occurred that you should know about and which requires your immediate
attention.</li>
<li>WARNING (shown with logging level 2 or above) - This is when something
hasn't worked but which doesn't affect BSR's ability to continue
working. The exception to this is when there's a warning
stating that "Auto-reboot may not work". This is a warning that the STATS could
not be obtained. If the STATS can't be obtained, then no attempt to reboot the
router will be made. See 
<a href="troubleshooting.htm">Troubleshooting</a> for more information.</li>
<li>INFO (shown with logging level 3 or above) - This is when the router has
done something that you might be interested in such as doing an automatic
reboot, or completing a set of custom commands.</li>
<li>COMMAND (shown with logging level 4 or above) - This is when a command has
been sent to the router.</li>
<li>STATS (shown with logging level 5 or above) - This contains the following
fields separated by a semi colon:
<ul>
<li>The uptime in hours:minutes:seconds</li>
<li>The downstream sync speed</li>
<li>The downstream noice margin (SNR)</li>
<li>The number of received bytes on the PPP interface (i.e. WAN) since last reboot</li>
<li>The number of transmitted bytes on the PPP interface (i.e. WAN) since last reboot</li>
</ul>
The Internet is not contacted to obtain these stats.</li>
<li>WEBPAGE (shown with logging level 6 or above) - This is when BSR connects
to the web sites to
check that the Internet connection is up. If there are any errors, the long
description is provided in this long file. This long description is the 
equivalent of the abbreviated description in the tooltip. See <a href=
"running-desktop.htm">Desktop</a> for more information on the short
description.</li>
</ol>
A logging level of 6 (or above) will show "everything" in the log file, and a
logging level of 0 will log nothing.
