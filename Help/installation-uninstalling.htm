<h1>Uninstalling BSR</h1>
To uninstall BSR, it is best (by far) to use "Add or Remove Programs" in
the Control Panel (or Programs and Features in Vista). BSR appears as
"BSR" in the list of
applications.<br><br>
Uninstallation removes all relevant registry entries and files with one exception: the
log files are not removed. If you then install BSR, the current log
files are kept and used in the new installation (if the date is the same). The
default location of the log files on Windows XP is "C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\My
Documents\Mossywell\BSR".<br><br>
In addition,
if uninstallation is attempted whilst BSR is running, Windows
Installer will close the application first.<br><br>
If you run into problems uninstalling, use the information in the
<a href="installation-details.htm">Installation Details</a> section to strip out
any settings manually.
