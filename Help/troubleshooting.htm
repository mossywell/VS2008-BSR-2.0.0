<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
In practice, BSr
should be self sufficient in that if, for example, there are incorrect config file
entries, it will simply use the defaults and put those defaults back into the
registry. However, some conditions may occur that cause an unusual response.
This section deals with those conditions in a symptomatic manner.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<ul>


<li>A dialog has appeared stating that an unexpected exception has occurred.
There are various forms that this dialog can take depending on whether the JIT
debugger is enabled and whether the CLR has generated the error and so on.
However, they all have the same feature: they all look serious! I've tried to
capture and handle all exceptions that I think reasonably can occur. However,
it is always possible that I've missed one. :-)<br><br> 
Resolution: If one does appear, by all means PM it to me at www.skyuser.co.uk 
and I'll take a look.<br><br>  
</li>


<li>A dialog has appeared stating that BSR is running:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/dialog-bsrrunning.png"></div><br><br>
Resolution: As only one instance of BSr can be run at any time, take
a look in the System Tray (bottom right, normally). If you can't see it there,
it's possible that it is running but has disappeared for some reason. Press
Ctrl-Alt-Del and use the Task Manager to kill off an executable called 
Mossywell.BSR.exe. Don't worry: it won't cause any harm to kill off
BSr abruptly.<br><br>  
</li>


<li>A dialog has appeared stating that BSR is running under a
different user login:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/dialog-bsrrunning-global.png"></div><br><br>
Resolution: As only one instance of BSr can be run at any time 
on any computer and it is already running on this computer, it cannot be run
again without stopping the other instance. To do this, you will need to login
to that account (or switch to it in the case of Fast User Switching on Windows
XP) and close it down.<br><br>  
</li>

<li>A dialog has appeared stating that a critical error has occurred (the text
in the second line of the error may differ from the one below, which is only
given as an example):<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/dialog-critical.png"></div><br><br>
Resolution: This is a "catch all" error for anything critical that happens and
which prevents BSr running any longer. The error can vary
depending on the cause of the problem. If this happens, please PM me at
www.skyuser.co.uk and I'll take a look.<br><br>  
</li>

<li>A dialog has appeared stating that a new version is available (the actual
version numbers may differ from this):<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/dialog-newversion.png"></div><br><br>
Resolution: Click on the "Yes" button to download the new version, or the "No"
button to cancel this dialog.<br><br>  
</li>

<li>A dialog has appeared stating that the application is shutting down because
there is an error writing to the log file:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/dialog-logerror.png"></div><br><br>
Resolution: BSr will not run if it cannot write to the log file.
This is by design and there is no way around it. If you get this error, check
the cause of why the log file cannot be written to. The error message states
the log file location. Possible explanations include:
<ul>
<li>The file is read only. This would have to have been done manually.</li>
<li>The file or directory doesn't have write permissions.</li>
<li>The file is open in an editor that locks the file exclusively.</li>
</ul>
When you have resolved the cause of the error, restart BSr.
<br><br>  
</li>


<li>I'm getting occasional errors in the log file: "A worker
thread had to be forcibly closed. The thread state was changed from Running to
Stopped."<br><br>
Resolution: Ignore this. BSr is multi-threaded. In simple terms,
this means that the user interface (the bit you can see), the attempts to
connect to the Internet, and the attempts to connect to the router to retrieve
statistics all run on their own separate threads. There are times when we want
to close these threads immediately. Those cases are logged in the event log. 
They are:
<ul>
<li>When the custom commands are run. Due to the internal logic, it is best not
to have BSr interrogating the web sites when the custom commands
are queued. Therefore, rather than wait for them to finish, the application
closes the threads and destroys and resources used. As the thread is only
performing read-only operations (write operations are marshalled onto the UI
thread, if you're interested), this is safe.</li>
<li>When the application is closed. Threads are again killed off
unceremoniously in this instance and resources destroyed manually. In .Net
this probably isn't necessary, but old habits die hard!</li>
</ul>
</li><br><br>


<li>BSr seems to be consuming huge amounts of memory. For
example, the Task Manager shows it using over 20MB of memory.<br><br>
Resolution: Do nothing - this is normal. The application is written in c#
(pronounced C Sharp) and uses the .Net framework. This requires some
explanation. In the very old days, when you wanted to get a computer to do
something, you had to write a program that not only did what you wanted it to
do, you also had to write all the code to display things on screens (or punch
cards!) and so on. Then, the idea of operating systems came along. They allowed
the programmer to concentrate on their own code and when they wanted to write
to disk (for example), they simply told the operating system, and it did all
the work. Similarly, when you needed to reserve some memory, you simply ask
the operating system for some and it goes off and gets it for you (instead of
having to find unused memory yourself and keeping in that space, as it used to
be done). When you finish using the memory, you tell the operating system and
it releases the memory making it available to other applications or itself.
That's a simple version of what most non-.Net (and non-Java) applications
still do. Then, along came the .Net Framework. Basically, the Framework is
an application in its own right and runs BSr inside it. The
.Net Framework does its own memory management, so when BSr
requests some memory for an object, it asks the Framework and the Framework
asks the operating system. The two consequences are 1. that the Framework
itself needs a lot of memory, and 2. when an application tells the Framework
that it no longer needs the memory, the Framework doesn't tell the operating
system but instead holds onto it just in case it is needed again. It only
releases it (i.e. tells the operating system) when it is sure that it is no
longer needed. This has the advantage that memory is readily available to the
application when it is needed and the operating system doesn't spend huge
amounts of time creating and freeing memory in quick succession. If the
operating system gets short of memory, it tells the .Net Framework, which
then releases all that it can. So, .Net Framework applications all consume vast
amounts of memory, but most importantly, they only do so if it is available
and not needed by the operating system.</li><br><br>


<li>The log file says: "WARNING, Another Administrator is connected to the
router. Auto-reboot functionality is now disabled."
Also, the router stats show question marks.<br><br>
Resolution: This happens if another PC / laptop has been used to log into the
web interface of router within the Administrator timeout period (3 minutes by
default), or if you are running BSr on multiple devices. If it is
the latter, deinstall BSr on all devices except the main one (the
one that is left on all the time is the recommended one). There is no advantage
in running BSr on many devices! If it is the former, log out of
the web interface on the other PC / laptop and after the Administrator login 
timeout period has passed, BSr will be able to log in again.
NOTE: Whilst BSr is showing this error, the auto-reboot
functionality will not work. If you are keen to have it working immediately,
you will need to power cycle the router to clear the old login.
</li><br><br>


<li>The log file says: "WARNING, Problem communicating with router. Auto-reboot
functionality is now disabled." Also, the router stats show question marks.<br>
<br>
Resolution: If it happens many times in a row,
check the config file for the IP address of the router and the
password used to log in. This will happen, for example, if the Sky router is not
your default gateway (perhaps it is a downstream router) and you have not used
the router_ip_override in the config file. It will also happen if the web login
password has been changed. Note that this does not affect BSr's
ability to connect to the Internet.
</li><br><br>


<li>The icon has gone amber or red! <img src="images\router-amber.bmp"> 
<img src="images\router-red.bmp"><br><br> 
Resolution: The resolution depends on the colour.<br>
If it is red, it means that contact
with the Internet has been lost. Normally, this will result in an automatic
reboot of the router, during which time it may stay red for a few minutes
and afterwards it should return back to green. However, the exception
is when custom commands have been run and one of them causes a disconnection.
The algorithm for custom commands is to disable the automatic reboot functionality
until BSr has connected to the Internet. This ensures that if a
command does cause a disconnection, it doesn't cause a reboot. NOTE: If you
run a custom command that permanently causes a disconnection, the router will
never be rebooted automatically. So, take care with the custom commands and 
test them. Then test them again. (You get the picture!)<br>
If the icon is yellow, check the log file for which web site is uncontactable.
Try to access it using a web browser. If the browser can't connect, it probably
means that the site is down. 
</li><br><br>


<li>When downloading a torrent, BSr keeps rebooting my router!
<br><br> 
Resolution: This is because torrents can hog bandwidth and leave little else
for other traffic. "Other traffic" in this case includes BSr's
own URL check. So, the URL check takes too long and BSr thinks
that the Internet connection has been lost, so it reboots the router. Try
increasing the url_check_timeout value in the <a href="running-configfile.htm">
config file</a>. 
</li><br><br>


<li>BSr keeps rebooting my router.<br><br> 
Resolution: This is probably because you have set the SNR threshold too low.
When you do that, connectivity is restored after a reboot, but at that point
BSr checks the SNR and discovers it to be below the threshold
that you have set, so it initiates a new reboot. Try increasing the
snr_reboot_threshold value in the <a href="running-configfile.htm">
config file</a>.
