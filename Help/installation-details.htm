<h1>Installation Details</h1>
This section explains how to install, what is installed and where. It is useful if you wish to
uninstall the software manually, for example.<br><br>

The setup program adds an icon to the desktop and start menu.

<h2><a name="Installed_Files">Installed Files</a></h2>
The default installation directory is:
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Mossywell\BSR</li>
</ul>
As of version 1.7.0, the files installed into this directory are:<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="bold">File</td>
<td class="bold">Details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>README.TXT</td>
<td>Last minute and version information about the application not present in
the help pages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mossywell.BSR.exe</td>
<td>The application itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mossywell.WebUtils2.dll</td>
<td>A supporting DLL that handles the HTTP communications asynchronously and
which is responsible for marshalling calls back onto the UI thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mossywell.NetUtils1.dll</td>
<td>A supporting DLL that obtains detailed routing table information
(more detail than is provided by the framework).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mossywell.BSR.exe.config</td>
<td>The XML configuration file. This application uses XML rather than the
registry to store information as this is the standard being pushed by Microsoft
for .Net applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BSR.chm</td>
<td>This help file!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bounce.wav</td>
<td>A wav file that is played (if it exists) when the router is rebooted
automatically. Replace this with your favourite router reboot sound. (You
do have one don't you?)</td>
</tr>

<h2><a name="Registry_Settings">Registry Settings</a></h2>
The Windows Installer saves a plethora of registry settings. They're
not listed here, but a trawl for the word "mossywell" in the registry will
dig them out.
