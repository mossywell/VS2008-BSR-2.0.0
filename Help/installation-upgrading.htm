<h1>Upgrading BSR</h1>
The method of upgrading BSR depends on the current version that is running.
If it is less than 1.0.0, you will need to uninstall BSR via Add / Remove
Programs and then install the new version. If it is 1.0.0 or greater, just run the setup program
as described in the <a href="installation-details.htm">Installation</a> section. You do not need
to close BSR first if it is still running because the installer closes it for you.
