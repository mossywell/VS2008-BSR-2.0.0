<h1>BSR Desktop</h1>
<h2>Desktop Icon</h2>
Once installed, the application will show as a shortcut icon on the desktop:
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="text-align: center;" src="images\desktop-icon.jpg">
</div><br><br>
Double-click on the icon to start it. Any settings saved in the XML file from
when BSR was last run, such as custom commands, will
automatically be loaded again. The default values, which are used when BSR is
run the first time, are as follows:
<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Router IP Override</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Router Username</td>
<td>admin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Router Password</td>
<td>sky</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">URL Timeout</td>
<td>5000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">URLs</td>
<td>http://www.google.co.uk<br>http://www.ebay.co.uk</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Custom Commands</td>
<td>None (but the config file does have sample commands)</td>
</tr>

</table><br><br>
<h2>System Tray Icon</h2>
Once running, BSR will appear as an icon in the system tray
(shown on the left in the following image):<br><br>
<div class="center">
<img src="images\tray-icons.jpg"></div><br><br>
Of course, your own icons will probably be different to this and the colour
may be different. If the mouse is hovered over the icon, the popup will also
show the following information.<br>
<br>
<div class="center">
<img src="images\running-mouseover.png"></div><br><br>
NOTE: The System Tray tooltip can only have a maximum of 63 characters
and each end of line (including the last one) takes two characters. If the string
to be displayed is longer than 63 characters, it is truncated to prevent an
exception (AKA a "crash"). So, if the text appears a bit odd, this is what may
have happened. The limitation is an operating system one, not an
application one.

<h2>System Tray Icon Symbols</h2>

The following table explains the meaning of the short Result codes shown
by BSR.<br><br>
<table>

<tr>
<td class="bold">Code</td>
<td class="bold">Meaning</td>

<td>OK</td>
<td>The response was received successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PE</td>
<td>ProtocolError: The response received from the server was complete but
indicated a protocol-level error. For example, an HTTP protocol error
such as 401 Access Denied would use this status. For example, you may not have
permissions to connect to this web site.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NRF</td>
<td>NameResolutionFailure: The name resolver service could not resolve
the host name. For example, the name of a non-existent web site was specified
in the config file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CF</td>
<td>ConnectFailure: The remote service point could not be contacted at the
transport level. This would indicate a low-level networking problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>Timeout: No response was received during the time-out period for a
request. For example, the web site might be down or running very slowly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SF</td>
<td>SendFailure: A complete request could not be sent to the remote server. For
example, the web server specified only accepts HTTPS, but HTTP was specified
in the config file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UE</td>
<td>UnknownError: A catch-all for all other errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>Data is unavailable.</td>
</tr>

<h2>The Context Menu</h2>
To administer BSR, right mouse click on the
icon. This will launch the <a href="running-contextmenu.htm">context menu</a>:
<br><br>
<div class="center">
<img src="images\context-menu.png"></div><br><br>

<h2>Pausing BSR</h2>
There may be times when BSR needs to be stopped. For example,
when planned maintenence is being done that will disconnect the router from
the computer. Rather than having to unload BSR, it can be paused
by double-clicking on the icon in the system tray. Pausing it effectively
disables all of the internal timed functions such as checking the router stats.
As a result, the auto-reboot functionality is suspended. However, it does
not disable the ability to load the config or log files, for
example. Double-clicking on the icon in the system tray again restarts it. Note
that this causes BSR immediately to check the router stats and
Internet connectivity.<br><br>
