This is where we need to be careful about the logic!

The Internet is contactable if:
1. Everything is running normally.
2.1. We've just done a reboot but haven't waited for a webpagergetter cycle.
2.2. We've done a reboot and are connected but the reboot never happened.
2.3. We've done a reboot and reconnected.
3.1. We've just done custom commands but haven't yet waited for a webpagegetter
     cycle.
3.2. We've done custom commands and are connected and a reboot never happened.
3.3. We've done custom commands and reconnected.
(They are mutually exclusive states and include all possible states. Therefore,
we only need to test for the 2nd and 4th and do nothing if it's the 1st or
3rd.)

Situation	RebootState							Action
1.			Normal								None
2.1.		RebootRequestedPreDelay				None (wait for timer to change state)
2.2.		RebootRequestedPostDelay			DoRunCustomCommands (as in, try anyway!)
2.3.		RebootRequestedPostDelay			DoRunCustomCommands
3.1.		CustomCommandsRequestedPreDelay		None (wait for timer to change state)
3.2.		CustomCommandsRequestedPostDelay	DoResetFlagsAndLogCompletion
3.3.		CustomCommandsRequestedPostDelay	DoResetFlagsAndLogCompletion

NOTE: 2.2. and 2.3. actually have the same state flag and action. (As do 3.2.
and 3.3.) This makes things easier as we just need to check the state and
act accordingly.
